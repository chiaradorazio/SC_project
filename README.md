## Multivariate Analysis on MonteCarlo data sample

In physics **data analysis**, we have usually two main categories of events (i.e. two different datasets): **signal** *events* that concern the physics we want to examine and **background** *events* that have similar properties to the ones we are looking for.
**Event selection** is a technique that loops on all events and decides whether to accept or to reject each of them, according to specific criteria. At the end of the selection, we will have weâ€™ll a sample of **candidates**, ideally made up of signal events.

This repository explores **multivariate analysis** for *events selection*, based on simulated data obtained by the a Monte Carlo program in order to e in order to to discriminate statistically events caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).

The goal of events selection is to test strategies for filtering events on separated signal and background datasets and then apply the best one on the unique dataset obtained by experiment.

## MVA
A way to improve the capability of event selection is to apply a linear or, even better, a non linear correlation between the discriminating variables (**multivariate analysis**). Some of these methods were successfully developed in the last decades thanks to improvement of computing performances and the most used in HEP analysis are the *Neural Network* and the *Boost Decision Trees* methods. As before, events are filtered according to a combination of variable values. The difference is that the cuts are no more chosen manually but by algorithms specific of the chosen method.

### Physical characteristics
Relevant Information:

The data are MC generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays by utilizing of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leak into the atmosphere and is recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photo-multiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons are collected in patterns, allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).

### Repository
The repository contains:
- tmva_train_SC.C  
It is a C++ function based on TMVA, a toolkit of ROOT which provides a ROOT-integrated machine learning environment. Once the datasets are opened and the Neural Network and BDT methods are booked, it trains and tests the methods and stamps the ROC curve in order to study the efficiency. 

A more detailed description is inside every file.
